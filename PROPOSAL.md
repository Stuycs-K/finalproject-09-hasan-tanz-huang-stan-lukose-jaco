# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Tanzeem Hasan, Stanley Huang, Jacob Lukose

# Intentions:

With this project, we will recreate the same Enigma machine that was used in World War II.
- Enigma encryption
- Enigma decryption
- Create our own version of enigma? GigEnigma. This one might incorporate more than the 26 letters of the alphabet. Oh, we can try using spanish.
- Visualize process using processing

# Intended usage:

Enter in a string and the program will produce the encrypted version of it. Enter a string encrypted by the enigma machine, and the program will produce the decrypted version.


# Technical Details:

(CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

A description of your technical design. This should include:

How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

- Randomly generated rotors
- Randomly generated text to show how the decrypting works
- One group member will work on coding the GigEnigma

# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
