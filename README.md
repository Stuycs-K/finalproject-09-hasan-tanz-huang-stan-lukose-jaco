# Enigma Machine

### The Enigmas

Tanzeem Hasan, Stanley Huang, Jacob Lukose

### Project Description:
This project will simulate the Enigma machine used in World War II.
With this project, we will recreate the Enigma machine that was used in World War II.
- Enigma encryption
- Enigma decryption
- Visualize process using processing
  - See the output at each step in the process using TAB
  - Manually change the order of the rotors used, along with the letters of the rotors currently being used using UP and DOWN arrow keys
  - Highlight the output letter after encrypting in a manner similar to the original enigma machine
  - Encrypt phrases or sentences and display the original and encrypted versions side by side
  - Use the DELETE or BACKSPACE keys to return to the previous rotor combination and erase your inputs


### Instructions:

The user does not need to install anything to run the program, just Python and Processing. In order to run the program, use "make vis" for the visualizer, "make encode ARGS="'plugboard' 'rotor order' 'rotor settings'" for encode, and "make decode" with optional arguments for the rotor order to run decode. 

For the visualizer, press any letter to see encode it, press BACKSPACE or DELETE to delete a letter, and press TAB to see each step of the encryption. Also, press either the rotor number or its setting and use UP or DOWN to adjust it. For encode/decode, just put in your input string.
