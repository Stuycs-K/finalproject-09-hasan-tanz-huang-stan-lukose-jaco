# The Enigma Machine
The Enigma Machine was a cipher device used by Germany in the 1940s to encrypt their communications. It had several parts, including a plugboard, rotors, a reflector and circuits to make the whole thing work. Decoding it was exceedingly difficult without knowing the precise rotor and plugboard combinations.
